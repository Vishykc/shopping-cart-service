A shopping cart service project for a company

# Assignment for job interview

## Assignment

Our goal is to build a small retail system that will allow our customer to purchase products via digital channels. We will build it following microservice architecture. Your assignment will be to build a component called **Shopping Cart**. This component should be able to:

- Provide current content of a cart for a particular customer
- Add a particular item to a cart
- Remove a particular item from a cart
- Evict a cart
- Provide statistics on how many offers of a particular id and action were sold in a particular period

With an item we should store:
- An identifier of a particular offer representing that item (i.e. if an item represents a Phillips TV, we need to store an identifier representing that TV. Metadata about the product is handled by another system called Product Catalog)
- An action that we are doing for this item. If we are purchasing an item, it will be ADD. If we are upgrading an item (i.e. buying a bigger subscription for something), it will be MODIFY. If we are removing an item (i.e. cancelling a subscription), it will be DELETE
- Prices which are a complex object

A price can be one of the two types:
- Recurring price: a price with which we are storing a number of recurrences (i.e. 12 months, 24 months, 7 days) and a price value
- One time price: a one-time price with which we are storing only a price value

**Rules**:
- Each item should have at least one price
- All the attributes of both items and prices are mandatory and should have their respective proper values

## Your task will be to:

Implement a desired application based on the described requirements (backend side only)

Present a solution and provide us with the code

Our recommended technologies to use are:

- Java/Kotlin with Spring Boot for the application
- MongoDB for the database

But any technology you would like is acceptable.
